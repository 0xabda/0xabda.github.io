      <description>Choosing a CMS In a previous post I mentioned why this blog was created. This post will present how it&#39;s contact form works.
At first, I quickly searched for blogging software that would suite my needs and found Hugo. I like the idea of a static website because:
 Generated files are static - They will faster when compared to loading from a database. There is no database that can fail on you (except the hard-drive of the server).</description>

      <title>New Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve decided to get a domain that would match my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having a domain that has no content when browsed to, seems like an odd thing to do.
Therefore, I&#39;ve created this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
